# 🚀 Streamlit Practice Projects

A collection of interactive web applications and experiments built using **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)** in **Python**.  
This repository serves as a learning playground to explore data visualization, machine learning model deployment, and modern app UI creation — all using simple Python scripts.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains multiple mini Streamlit apps demonstrating:
- Basics of Streamlit UI and layout
- Interactive widgets (inputs, sliders, dropdowns)
- Data visualization (charts, plots)
- Integration with machine learning models
- Data upload and analysis features

Each `.py` file represents a separate Streamlit application that can be run independently.

## 🎯 Objective

This repository is part of my personal journey to:
- Learn Streamlit for building AI/ML web apps  
- Understand backend-to-frontend integration in Python  
- Prototype data-driven dashboards quickly  
- Build foundations for future projects like **NotesGPT**
